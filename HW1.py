'''
Use any computing method you want.   This problem can be done on a spreadsheet (with
difficulty).  Or it might be easier to write your program in any of MatLab, R, python, or
fortran, etc.
============
Given:
2-D Domain:  xkm = 0 to 1000 km ,   zkm = 0 to 30 km
for your calculations, use dx = 20 km, and dz = 1 km or finer (I use dz=0.001 km).

Use the WRF definition of eta (eqs. 2.2 - 2.5 in WRF-ARW4 tech note 2019), where pi is dry
hydrostatic pressure (written as pd in the 2019 tech note).
Let:
pi_top = 2 kPa
eta_c = 0.3  . This is the eta value, above which eta becomes a pure pressure coordinate in
this hybrid system.

For any location x(km), vertical profiles of temperature are given by
T(degC) =   (40 - 0.08*xkm)  -  6.5*zkm     for 0 < zkm < 12
T(degC) =   (40 - 0.08*xkm)  -  6.5*12       for 12 < zkm   (i.e., isothermal above 12 km)
for zkm = height above sea level

Actual Mean Sea-Level (at z = 0) pressure is Pmsl = 95kPa + 0.01*xkm
Use the info above to determine P vs z, by iterating up from sea-level using hypsometric eq.
P2 = P1 * exp[ (z1-z2) / (a*Tkelvin) ]   where a = 0.0293 km/K.

This gives you the hydrostatic pressure (pi = P = pd) as a function of height.

NOTE: in WRF4 eq. (2.2), they use a REFERENCE sea-level pressure of Po = 100 kPa.  Yes, you
should use this reference value in eq. (2.2), even though you use the actual Pmsl pressure as
a basis for all your other calculations.

Intersecting the background pressure field that you just determined is the topography,
given in height above sera level by:

Zground_km = 1 km + (1km)*cos[ 2*(3.14159)*(xkm-500km) / 500km ]     for  250km < x < 750 km
and Zground = 0 elsewhere.

Find:  On an x-z graph, plot the altitudes (km) of the following isobaric surfaces:

Interpolate to find the Psurface (kPa) pressure at Zground. Namely, it is the pressure
that corresponds to eta = 1.
This pressure that you use to find eta in exercises (3) & (4).
Present the results in a table, where:
row1 = x, (km)
row2 = Zground, (km)
row3=Psfc (kPa)

#%% Part 3
'''
Create a new P-x graph, on which you plot lines of constant eta, for the eta values listed
below.  Namely, it should look something like WRF4 figure 2.1b, but with the more realistic
meteorology that I prescribed above.  Also, like that figure, plot pressure P on the vertical
axis in reversed order (highest pressure at the bottom of the figure), but don't use a log

z at the pressure levels that correspond to the requested eta values.
